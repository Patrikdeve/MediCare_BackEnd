/*
The catchAsyncError function is a higher-order function designed to handle asynchronous errors in Express.js route handlers. Here's a detailed explanation of how it works and why it's useful:

Explanation
Higher-Order Function:

catchAsyncError takes a function (theFunction) as an argument and returns a new function. This new function will be the actual middleware used in your routes.
Middleware Signature:

The returned function has the signature (req, res, next), which is standard for Express.js middleware and route handlers.
Handling Promises:

Inside the returned function, Promise.resolve(theFunction(req, res, next)) is used to ensure that theFunction is always treated as a promise. This is necessary because theFunction could be either synchronous or asynchronous.
Catching Errors:

.catch(next) is appended to the promise chain. If theFunction throws an error or returns a rejected promise, .catch(next) will catch that error and pass it to the next function.
In Express.js, calling next with an argument signals that an error occurred, and the error-handling middleware will be invoked.
Why It's Useful
Error Handling: It simplifies error handling in asynchronous route handlers. Without this, you'd need to wrap each asynchronous operation in a try-catch block.
Clean Code: It keeps your route handlers clean and focused on their main logic, rather than error handling.
Consistency: It ensures that all asynchronous errors are handled uniformly across your application.
